A/B Test Summary Report
Objective: Evaluate the impact of a feature change on user conversion rates.

Key Findings
Initial Imbalance Detected

Upon reviewing the original randomization of the A/B test, it was found that users from Argentina and Uruguay were significantly underrepresented in the control group.

Argentina: 17% in test vs. 5% in control

Uruguay: 1.7% in test vs. 0.2% in control

Corrective Action Taken

To ensure a fair comparison, the dataset was adjusted:

Users from Argentina and Uruguay were oversampled in the control group to match the distribution in the test group.

This adjustment corrected the randomization bias without affecting other user segments.

Test Results After Correction

A statistical t-test was performed on the corrected dataset.

T-statistic: -1.14

P-value: 0.25

Conclusion: There is no statistically significant difference in conversion rates between the test and control groups.

This means the feature did not lead to a measurable improvement in user conversions.

Business Implications
The experiment is now statistically sound and free of geographic bias.

The tested feature or change does not justify a full rollout, as it did not improve performance in a meaningful way.

Future tests should include an audit of randomization at the beginning of the test to avoid biased results.

Recommendations
Do not proceed with feature rollout based on this test alone.

Continue testing with refined hypotheses or explore alternative enhancements to drive conversions.

Ensure balanced representation in both groups across key demographics (e.g., geography, device) in future experiments.
